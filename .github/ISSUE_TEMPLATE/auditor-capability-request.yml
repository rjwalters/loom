        **Auditor Capability Request**

        This template is used by the Auditor role to request enhanced validation capabilities.
        These issues are automatically created when the Auditor identifies gaps in its ability
        to validate the main branch effectively.

        **Note for maintainers**: Review these requests to prioritize validation infrastructure improvements.
