# AI Slop and the Future of Code Smell

*On taste, trust, and the strange new aesthetics of machine authorship*

## The “Slop” Reflex

There’s a new insult floating through the developer world:

> “That looks like LLM slop.”

It’s rarely about correctness. The code runs. It passes tests. It performs fine.  
But it doesn’t *feel* right to human eyes.

“Slop” has become shorthand for work that’s technically valid but aesthetically unfamiliar.  
It’s a word we reach for when we sense quality but can’t locate authorship.

## Drum Machines Have No Soul

In the 1980s, musicians started putting bumper stickers on their vans:

> **“Drum machines have no soul.”**

What they meant was: *we’re scared.*

Automation had come for rhythm — the most human of skills. The machines were too perfect, too steady, too literal.  
And yet those same tools gave birth to techno, house, and hip-hop — entire genres humans couldn’t have played unaided.

Every creative field goes through this cycle:

* Painters said it about photography.  
* Filmmakers said it about CGI.  
* Programmers are saying it about LLMs.

When mastery becomes abundant, taste becomes the last safe refuge of expertise.

## What We Mean by “Smell”

**Code smell** began as a practical heuristic: signals that complexity was accumulating faster than comprehension.  
Long methods, deep nesting, duplicated logic — small hints of structural decay.

Over time, “smell” became cultural.

> “That smells wrong” meant “That’s not how we do it here.”

It stopped predicting failure and started enforcing norms. The word became a shield for taste — expertise disguised as objectivity.

Now, LLMs challenge that taste directly. They don’t share our sense of what “reads well.” They need different comments and architecture.  
Their coherence lives at a statistical level, not a stylistic one.

And that’s unsettling, because for humans, *style* has been how we detect quality work — and by extension, each other.  
Taste is our shorthand for trust. When we reject AI work as “slop,” we’re not defending quality — we’re defending identity.

Yet the boundary is already shifting. What once counted as lazy boilerplate is now what makes code legible to agents.  
We’re leaving a world where clarity was visual and entering one where clarity is *executable.*

## Machine Taste

When a model writes code, it’s not optimizing for beauty. It’s optimizing for *consistency.*

It produces patterns that make reasoning easier for itself: uniform naming, predictable structure, clear call chains.  
What looks flat to us might be transparent to another model. Machine legibility is its own aesthetic — one tuned for inference, not inspiration.

There’s a reason model-written code often integrates better with itself:

* Functions assume the same idioms.  
* Naming conventions are uniform.  
* Implicit architecture is stable.

Humans introduce entropy.  
Models introduce regularity.  
That regularity will start to look beautiful once we learn to see it.

## From Smell to Signal

If “code smell” once meant “this will rot over time,” the new smell is **opacity.**

A function that can’t be tested, explained, or reasoned about — by human or machine — that’s the real failure.  
Everything else is aesthetic preference.

Future linters won’t scold indentation. They’ll flag ambiguity.  
“Smells bad” will mean “the model can’t explain why this works.”

## The New Aesthetic

Every tool eventually teaches its own beauty.  
Photography taught us to love blur.  
Synthesizers taught us to love texture.  
Machine code will teach us to love verbose regularity — the rhythm of coherence without ego.

The future of craftsmanship in computer science will be about how clearly we express intent so that machines can build on it.

In time, we’ll stop calling it “AI slop.”  
Maybe we’ll start to call it *AI style.*
