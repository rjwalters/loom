# Shellcheck configuration for Loom shell scripts

# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source
#   Many scripts dynamically source files based on runtime paths.
#   shellcheck cannot resolve these, so we disable globally.
disable=SC1090

# SC1091: Not following sourced file (file not found or not specified)
#   Related to SC1090 -- sourced scripts may not be available at lint time.
disable=SC1091

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
#   This is a pervasive pattern across all scripts (77+ occurrences).
#   The pattern `local var=$(cmd)` masks the return value of cmd, but
#   in this codebase return values from these assignments are never
#   checked, so the risk is negligible. Fixing all instances would be
#   a large mechanical refactor with no practical benefit.
