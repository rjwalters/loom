## Operator Attention: Merge-Risk-Hold Pileup

Judge-approved PRs stuck under a `loom:operator` merge-risk hold — implementation work is done, only a human merge decision is missing.

- **#5995**: chore: resync installed Loom surfaces
- **#5619**: tokens: record (provider, upstream account id) in the pool storage layer

## Urgent

Issues flagged as highest priority (`loom:urgent`).

_None._

## Ready

Human-approved issues ready for implementation (`loom:issue`).

- **#5607**: tokens: record (provider, upstream account id) in the pool storage layer

## In Progress

Issues currently being built (`loom:building`).

_None._

## PRs Awaiting Review

PRs waiting on Judge (`loom:review-requested`).

_None._

## Approved (Awaiting Merge)

PRs that passed review and are queued for Champion auto-merge (`loom:pr`).

- **#5995**: chore: resync installed Loom surfaces
- **#5619**: tokens: record (provider, upstream account id) in the pool storage layer

## Proposed

Issues carrying `loom:curated`.

- **#6156**: Efficacy review: after ~300 merges, verify #6118's mergeable-recheck is behaving (and never merged a real conflict) *(curated)*
- **#6134**: Guide/Judge/Champion: fast-path review+merge for docs-only WORK_LOG/WORK_PLAN PRs *(curated)*
- **#6123**: Guard friction: worktree-write-confinement blocks gitignored build-artifact writes in the primary checkout *(curated)*
- **#6062**: Pulse (2amlogic.com) narrates closed-unmerged duplicate efforts; should narrate on merge / dedup by merged-PR *(curated)*
- **#5897**: sweep skill: presumed-dead Builder Task can survive a session roll — verify task liveness before re-dispatch (duplicate-builder hazard) *(curated)*
- **#5729**: loom-daemon is DOWN on robb-studio and watchdog recovery is exhausted *(curated)*
- **#5660**: Vendored guard-destructive-generic.sh has drifted ~2,200 lines ahead of its upstream, and the single-marker capability probe makes partial reconciliation unsafe *(curated)*
- **#5607**: tokens: record (provider, upstream account id) in the pool storage layer *(curated)*
- **#5512**: Quarantine stashes accumulate with no lifecycle — 37 across one fleet, oldest 9 days, all referencing closed issues *(curated)*
- **#5385**: Worktree-isolation guard fails closed on variable-expanded write paths that resolve outside the main checkout *(curated)*
- **#4496**: [Epic #4489 Phase 7] Run a multi-account Codex daemon canary and define the production-readiness gate *(curated)*
- **#4136**: measure: every sweep phase re-reads the repo from scratch — quantify the duplicated-read cost *(curated)*

## Proposed (Architect / Hermit)

- **#4196**: Proposal: safehouse room as the primary Loom operator interface (narrate → workers speak → steer → parity) *(architect)*
- **#4167**: Proposal: first-class multi-runtime worker support (Claude Code, Codex, Amp, oh-my-pi) via a runtime adapter contract *(architect)*
- **#3979**: Architecture: elastic compute — expand sweep parallelism onto cloud worker hosts when local CPU saturates *(architect)*

## Epics

- **#6109**: Add a runtime-neutral scientific research lifecycle with evidence-gated phase contracts
- **#4489**: [Epic #4167 Phase 4] Routinely deploy Codex through loom-daemon with provider-aware account management
