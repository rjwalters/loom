This issue is a duplicate of #2568, which was already fixed by PR #2577 (merged 2026-02-17).

PR #2577 implemented all three protections requested in this issue:
1. File-based claim checking via has_valid_claim() (orphan_recovery.py:386)
2. Label grace period via _get_building_label_age() with 600s threshold (orphan_recovery.py:327-336)
3. Fresh progress re-read via _has_fresh_progress() (orphan_recovery.py:692-699)

The fix is already on main and present in this worktree's branch base.
