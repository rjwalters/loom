# Assume Loom Role

Randomly select and assume an archetypal role from the Loom orchestration system, then perform one iteration of work following that role's guidelines.

## Process

1. **List available roles**: Check `defaults/roles/*.md` or `.loom/roles/*.md`
2. **Select one at random**: Use current timestamp or random selection
3. **Read the role definition**: Load the markdown file for the selected role
4. **Follow the role's workflow**: Complete ONE iteration only (one task, one PR review, one issue triage, etc.)
5. **Report results**: Summarize what you accomplished with links to issues/PRs modified

## Available Roles

- **builder.md** - Claim `loom:issue` issue, implement feature/fix, create PR with `loom:review-requested`
- **judge.md** - Review PR with `loom:review-requested`, approve or request changes, update labels
- **curator.md** - Find unlabeled issue, enhance with technical details, mark as `loom:curated`
- **champion.md** - Evaluate `loom:curated` issues, promote to `loom:issue` or provide feedback
- **architect.md** - Create architectural proposal issue with `loom:architect` label
- **hermit.md** - Analyze codebase complexity, create bloat removal issue with `loom:hermit`
- **healer.md** - Fix bug or address PR feedback, maintain existing PRs
- **guide.md** - Triage batch of issues, update priorities and labels for workflow
- **driver.md** - Execute direct task or command (plain shell, no specific workflow)

## Work Scope

Complete **ONE** meaningful task following the selected role's guidelines, then **stop and report**.

### Task Examples by Role

**Builder**: Claim one `loom:issue` issue â†’ implement â†’ test â†’ commit â†’ create PR
**Judge**: Review one PR with `loom:review-requested` â†’ provide feedback â†’ approve/request changes
**Curator**: Find one unlabeled issue â†’ add context â†’ tag as `loom:curated`
**Champion**: Evaluate `loom:curated` issues (max 2) â†’ promote to `loom:issue` or provide feedback
**Architect**: Identify one architectural need â†’ create detailed proposal issue
**Hermit**: Analyze codebase section â†’ identify bloat â†’ create removal issue
**Healer**: Fix one bug or address one PR comment â†’ update PR â†’ push changes
**Guide**: Review issue backlog â†’ update priorities â†’ add/remove labels for batch
**Driver**: Execute one direct command or task per user instruction

## Report Format

After completing your iteration, report:

```
âœ“ Role Assumed: [Role Name]
âœ“ Task Completed: [Brief description]
âœ“ Changes Made:
  - [Issue/PR #XXX]: [Description with link]
  - [Label changes]
  - [Files modified if applicable]
âœ“ Next Steps: [Suggestions for follow-up or ready state]
```

## Label Workflow

Follow the label-based coordination system (ADR-0006):

- Issues: `loom:curated` â†’ `loom:issue` â†’ `loom:building` â†’ closed
- PRs: `loom:review-requested` â†’ `loom:pr` â†’ merged
- Proposals: `loom:architect` â†’ reviewed â†’ implemented or closed
- Suggestions: `loom:hermit` â†’ reviewed â†’ implemented or closed

## Activity Logging

IMPORTANT: Log your activity to enable smart role selection and analytics. Use `trigger: 'heuristic'` to mark this as automatic role selection.

### At Work Start

```typescript
import { logActivity } from './src/lib/activity-logger';

const startTime = Date.now();
const workspacePath = process.cwd(); // Or use workspace detection
const selectedRole = '<role-name>'; // e.g., 'builder', 'judge', etc.

await logActivity(workspacePath, {
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  role: selectedRole,
  trigger: 'heuristic', // IMPORTANT: Use 'heuristic' for /loom command
  work_found: false, // Update after checking for work
  outcome: 'in-progress'
});
```

### At Work End

```typescript
await logActivity(workspacePath, {
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  role: selectedRole,
  trigger: 'heuristic', // IMPORTANT: Use 'heuristic' for /loom command
  work_found: true, // or false if no work found
  work_completed: true, // or false if blocked/incomplete
  issue_number: 123, // If applicable
  duration_ms: Date.now() - startTime,
  outcome: 'completed', // or 'no-work', 'blocked', 'error'
  notes: 'Selected role via /loom, completed task'
});
```

### Outcome Values

- `completed`: Successfully finished work
- `no-work`: No work found for selected role
- `blocked`: Found work but couldn't proceed (dependencies, etc.)
- `error`: Encountered error during execution

### Trigger Value

For the `/loom` command, ALWAYS use:
- `trigger: 'heuristic'` - Indicates automatic role selection (NOT manual /builder, /judge, etc.)

This allows tracking which work came from random selection vs explicit role invocation.

### Error Handling

Wrap logging in try/catch to ensure it never breaks your work:

```typescript
try {
  await logActivity(workspacePath, { /* ... */ });
} catch (error) {
  console.error('[activity-logger] Failed to log:', error);
  // Continue with work
}
```

## Notes

- This command simulates one terminal's work in the Loom multi-terminal orchestration system
- Multiple Claude Code sessions can run `/loom` in parallel for distributed work
- Each iteration should be atomic and complete (don't leave partial work)
- Always update labels appropriately to signal state to other roles
- Check for existing work to avoid conflicts (e.g., don't claim already `in-progress` issues)

## Example Usage

```bash
# In Claude Code terminal
/loom

# Claude responds:
"ðŸŽ­ Rolling random role... Assuming the Judge role for this iteration.
