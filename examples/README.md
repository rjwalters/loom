## How to Use These Templates

### Option 1: Copy to Existing Project

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Copy the template you want (quickstart or full-stack)
cp -r /path/to/loom/examples/quickstart/.loom .

# Start Loom and select your project as workspace
# Click "Start Workspace" to create terminals
```

### Option 2: Start a New Project

```bash
# Create and initialize new project
mkdir my-new-project
cd my-new-project
git init

# Copy template
cp -r /path/to/loom/examples/full-stack/.loom .

# Open Loom, select this directory, and start workspace
```

## What Gets Committed

When you use these templates, you should **commit the `.loom/` directory** to version control:

‚úÖ **Commit these** (shared with team):
```
.loom/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json          # Terminal configurations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ roles/               # Custom role definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Documentation
```

‚ùå **Don't commit these** (automatically gitignored):
```
.loom/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .daemon.pid         # Dev script PID file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .daemon.log         # Dev script logs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ daemon.sock         # IPC socket
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state.json          # Current terminal state
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ activity.db         # Activity tracking database
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ worktrees/          # Git worktrees (one per issue)
```

Note: Production daemon logs are written to `~/.loom/daemon.log` (home directory).

Each template includes a `.gitignore` file with the correct patterns.

## Customizing Templates

After copying a template, you can:

1. **Add custom roles** - Create `.loom/roles/my-role.md`
2. **Modify config** - Edit `.loom/config.json` to change terminal settings
3. **Adjust intervals** - Change autonomous operation timing
4. **Change themes** - Update terminal color themes

See [../.loom/README.md](../.loom/README.md) for detailed customization guide.

## Label Workflow

Both templates use GitHub labels to coordinate work between agents:

- `loom:ready` (green) - Issue ready for implementation
- `loom:in-progress` (yellow) - Currently being worked on
- `loom:review-requested` (green) - PR ready for review
- `loom:reviewing` (amber) - Under active review
- `loom:approved` (blue) - PR approved, ready to merge

See [../WORKFLOWS.md](../WORKFLOWS.md) for complete workflow documentation.

## Troubleshooting

### Terminals not launching?
- Ensure you're in a git repository (`git init` if needed)
- Check Claude Code is installed and in PATH
- Review console logs for errors

### Workers not finding issues?
- Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` (macOS) or equivalent
- Authenticate: `gh auth login`
- Create issues with `loom:ready` label

### Configuration not loading?
- Ensure `.loom/config.json` has valid JSON
- Check file permissions (should be readable)
- Try factory reset: **File** ‚Üí **Factory Reset Workspace**

## Next Steps

- Read [../WORKFLOWS.md](../WORKFLOWS.md) for advanced multi-agent patterns
- Explore [../defaults/roles/README.md](../defaults/roles/README.md) to create custom roles
- Check [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for development context

Happy coding with Loom! üßµ‚ú®
