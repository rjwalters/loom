//! Epic #7810's subcommands: those that back a retired shell script, plus the
//! epic's own instrumentation (`shell-budget`).
//!
//! Every variant here is the implementation behind a `defaults/scripts/*.sh`
//! entry point that is now a thin stub. The stubs' names, flags, stdout and
//! exit codes are contract — role prompts invoke them by path and parse or
//! `eval` their output — so these subcommands inherit that contract.
//!
//! They are gathered into one flattened enum for two reasons. They are one
//! family, added and reviewed together as the epic lands each port; and
//! `main.rs` is over `.loom/docs/file-size-policy.md`'s threshold and frozen,
//! so each new port must cost it nothing. Flattening keeps every subcommand
//! top-level on the CLI (`loom-daemon classify-dependency-block`, not
//! `loom-daemon script-ports classify-dependency-block`) while `main.rs` holds
//! a single variant and a single dispatch arm for all of them.
