# guard-background-subagents.sh — Stop hook backstop for issue #4257
#
# Mechanical backstop for the hazard documented in
# defaults/.claude/commands/loom/sweep.md under "CRITICAL: Subagent dispatch is
# async-only — you MUST block explicitly (issue #3822)": in headless
# `claude -p` mode, ending the orchestrator's turn terminates the process,
# which kills every still-running background Task subagent. That section is a
# documentation-only guardrail; this hook is the mechanical backstop for when
# an orchestrator forgets it and tries to end its turn anyway.
#
# Contract (Stop hook):
#   Input (JSON on stdin): { "session_id": "...", "transcript_path": "...",
#     "stop_hook_active": true|false, "hook_event_name": "Stop", ... }
#   Output: to block the stop, print `{"decision":"block","reason":"..."}` to
#     stdout and exit 0. To allow the stop, exit 0 with no output.
#
# Detection heuristic: scan the transcript JSONL for two independent
# dispatch-without-observed-completion patterns:
#
#   1. Assistant `tool_use` entries named "Task" (the harness's subagent-
#      dispatch tool) whose id has no matching `tool_result` anywhere later
#      in the transcript — i.e. a subagent was dispatched and the transcript
#      never observed its completion before the orchestrator tried to end its
#      turn.
#   2. Assistant `Bash` `tool_use` entries with `input.run_in_background ==
#      true` (issue #4389 — the #4257 recurrence) whose dispatch id has no
#      matching `<task-notification>...<tool-use-id>ID</tool-use-id>...`
#      completion event anywhere later in the transcript. A background Bash
#      dispatch gets an IMMEDIATE `tool_result` ack ("Command running in
#      background with ID: ...") at dispatch time — that ack is NOT
#      completion, so pattern (1)'s tool_result-matching logic would (and
#      did, in the #4347 death) treat it as already resolved. The real
#      completion arrives later as a `task-notification` message whose
#      `<tool-use-id>` tag echoes the original dispatch id; only that event
#      counts as resolution for a background Bash task.
#
# In both cases, this is a HEURISTIC over the transcript file, not a live
# process check (no such live signal exists here), so it can have false
# positives (e.g. a slow transcript flush) — hence the single-block semantics
# below rather than a hard, repeatable deny.
#
# Loop guard: `stop_hook_active` is true when this hook itself caused an
# earlier block in the current stop sequence. Blocking unconditionally on that
# second pass would wedge the session in an infinite "you must continue" loop
# the orchestrator can never satisfy if the heuristic keeps re-firing (e.g. a
# tool_result that legitimately never lands in this transcript format). So:
# block AT MOST ONCE per stop sequence, then allow.
#
# Toggle: guards.backgroundSubagents (default true) / LOOM_GUARD_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS
# env override, same env > config > default precedence as every other guard
# category in this repo (see guard-worktree-paths.sh).
#
# Error handling: this script MUST NEVER exit non-zero, and any unexpected
# error (missing jq, unreadable/unparseable transcript, malformed input)
# fails OPEN (allow the stop) rather than wedging the session.
