Use `gh issue list --label=\"loom:curated\" --state=open` to find issues needing evaluation. For each issue (max 2 per iteration): (1) Evaluate against 8 quality criteria (clear problem, technical feasibility, implementation clarity, value alignment, scope, quality standards, risk assessment, completeness), (2) If ALL criteria pass: remove `loom:curated`, add `loom:issue`, and comment with approval reason, (3) If ANY criteria fail: keep `loom:curated`, comment with specific concerns and recommendations. Conservative bias - when in doubt, do NOT promote. Always leave audit trail comments.",
