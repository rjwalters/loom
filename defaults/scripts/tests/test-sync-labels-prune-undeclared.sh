# test-sync-labels-prune-undeclared.sh - sync-labels.sh --prune-undeclared
# (#11105).
#
# A label that leaves labels.yml stays on the forge: the additive sync never
# deletes a Loom label, so retired and never-declared loom:* names pile up in
# the label picker. --prune-undeclared reports them (--dry-run) and deletes
# the unused ones; the logic is `loom-daemon labels undeclared`, so this suite
# pins the working-tree binary (lib/require-daemon-bin.sh) and stubs only
# `gh`. No network, no real label mutation.
#
# The load-bearing assertions:
#   1. --dry-run reports every undeclared loom:* label (and only those: a
#      declared label, a non-loom: label and a loom: label on an open issue
#      are not "would delete"), and deletes nothing.
#   2. A label on an open issue/PR is KEPT and named with its numbers, in both
#      modes; it is never deleted.
#   3. Without --dry-run the unused undeclared labels are deleted, nothing
#      else is, and the run still succeeds (exit 0) while warning that a kept
#      label remains.
#   4. A bare --dry-run (no --prune-undeclared) stays forge-free.
#   5. --help documents the flag.
#
# Usage:
#   ./defaults/scripts/tests/test-sync-labels-prune-undeclared.sh
