# loom-daemon-watchdog.sh - Host-side autonomy-loss detector for the RAW
# loom-daemon process (Issue #4011).
#
# THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES
#   On 2026-07-26 the loom-daemon launchd job took a SIGTERM two seconds after
#   starting and was left `bootout`-ed (unloaded) from launchd. Autonomous
#   dispatch (work finder, role runner) silently stopped. NOTHING surfaced it —
#   no log line, no forge signal, no notification. It was discovered hours later
#   only because someone happened to run `loom-daemon status` by hand. A pull
#   nobody performed for hours is not a detector.
#
# WHAT THIS IS
#   The payload of a SECOND launchd job (`<daemon-label>-watchdog`) that runs on
#   a `StartInterval` cadence, SEPARATE from the daemon job. It compares two
#   things:
#     (1) operator INTENT — the durable `autonomy-desired` marker that
#         loom-daemon-start.sh writes on a successful start and only an
#         operator-initiated loom-daemon-stop.sh removes; and
#     (2) REALITY — whether a daemon for the expected launchd label is actually
#         loaded and alive, and whether its declared-cadence heartbeat file
#         (written by the daemon, #4011) is fresh.
#   When intent says "a daemon should be running" but reality disagrees, it
#   REPORTS loudly (a timestamped line to the watchdog log + stderr, which
#   launchd captures) instead of staying silent.
#
# WHY A SECOND LAUNCHD JOB, NOT A RESIDENT PROCESS
#   The reporter must live OUTSIDE the daemon process: a dead daemon cannot
#   report its own death (which is why #3971's in-daemon watch loop is not
#   reusable here). And it must itself be supervised — but a long-lived resident
#   watchdog just moves the "who watches the watchdog" problem up one level (it
#   too can crash and stay dead). A `StartInterval` job owns NO long-lived
#   process: launchd re-runs it every interval regardless of how the last run
#   exited, so it structurally cannot crash-and-stay-dead. That is what resolves
#   the recursion.
#
# WHY THE MARKER, NOT "is the pid file / launchd job present"
#   loom-daemon-stop.sh boots out the job AND deletes the pid file, so after ANY
#   stop those would be gone — making a deliberately-stopped daemon and a
#   silently-dead one byte-identical. A detector built on them would page on
#   every intentional stop or never page at all. The marker's lifetime is
#   OPERATOR INTENT: present ⇒ a daemon is expected; absent ⇒ it was
#   deliberately stopped (or never started) ⇒ stay silent.
#
# EXIT CODES (a StartInterval job's exit code does not affect relaunch — these
# exist for testability and for a human running it by hand):
#   0  no divergence — daemon healthy, OR no daemon is expected (marker absent)
#   1  DIVERGENCE reported — a daemon is expected but is not running, or is
#      running but its heartbeat is stale (possibly wedged)
#   2  usage error
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-watchdog.sh            Check once, report on divergence
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-watchdog.sh --verbose  Also log the healthy/idle no-op cases
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-watchdog.sh --help
#
# Environment:
#   LOOM_AUTONOMY_MARKER           Path to the intent marker (default: derived
#                                  from LOOM_SOCKET_PATH's dir, else ~/.loom/autonomy-desired)
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_LOG              Report log path (default: <loom dir>/logs/daemon-watchdog.log)
#   LOOM_DAEMON_HEARTBEAT_STALE_SECS  Staleness threshold in seconds (default:
#                                  max(5 × heartbeat cadence, 300))
#   LOOM_SOCKET_PATH              Override the daemon socket (its dir is the loom dir)
#   LOOM_LAUNCHD_LABEL            macOS: the DAEMON label to probe (default com.rjwalters.loom-daemon)
#   LOOM_LAUNCHD_DOMAIN          macOS: pin the launchd domain (gui/<uid> or user/<uid>);
#                                else auto-resolved gui→user (#4130), matching the start
#   LOOM_DAEMON_LAUNCHD          0/false/no: treat as a non-launchd (nohup) daemon; check the pid file only
