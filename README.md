# Loom

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/rjwalters/loom/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/rjwalters/loom)

> AI-powered development orchestration through multi-terminal workspace management

**Multi-terminal workspace where AI agents embody distinct roles—Worker, Curator, Architect, Reviewer, Critic, Fixer—weaving chaos into creation.**

Loom turns **GitHub itself** into the ultimate development interface. Each issue, label, and pull request becomes part of a living workflow orchestrated by AI workers that read, write, and review code—all through your existing GitHub repo.

---

## Quick Start

### For End Users (Using Loom)

Skip the prerequisites and get Loom installed in your repository:

```bash
# Option 1: Interactive Install (Easiest)
# Clone Loom and run the install script
git clone https://github.com/rjwalters/loom
cd loom
./install.sh /path/to/your/repo

# Option 2: Direct CLI Initialization
# Download and run loom-daemon to initialize your repository
./loom-daemon init /path/to/your/repo

# Option 3: GUI Application
# Download Loom.app from releases and open with your workspace
open -a Loom --args --workspace /path/to/your/repo
```

**What this does**: Creates `.loom/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/`, and `.github/` in your repository.

**Next steps**: [10-Minute Quickstart Tutorial](docs/guides/quickstart-tutorial.md) - Learn the complete workflow hands-on.

### For Contributors (Building Loom)

Want to contribute to Loom itself?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rjwalters/loom
cd loom
pnpm install
pnpm app:dev
```

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for complete development setup and guidelines.

### Repository Maintenance

Two convenience scripts are available at the repository root:

**Installation Helper** (`./install.sh`):
```bash
# Interactive installer with guided prompts
./install.sh

# Install to specific repository
./install.sh /path/to/your/repo
```

Provides two installation workflows:
- **Quick Install**: Direct installation via `loom-daemon init`
- **Full Install**: Creates GitHub issue, worktree, and PR for review

**Cleanup Helper** (`./clean.sh` in Loom repo, `./.loom/scripts/clean.sh` in target repos):
```bash
# In Loom repository
./clean.sh --dry-run

# In target repositories (after installation)
./.loom/scripts/clean.sh --dry-run

# Options
--deep       # Include build artifacts (target/, node_modules/)
--dry-run    # Preview what would be cleaned
```

Safely removes:
- Orphaned worktrees and stale branches
- Loom tmux sessions
- Build artifacts (with `--deep`)
- **Installed automatically** to `.loom/scripts/` in target repositories

---

## Before You Install

### What Loom Does

Loom transforms your repository into an AI-orchestrated workspace where agents coordinate through GitHub issues, PRs, and labels. Each terminal can embody a specialized role (Worker, Curator, Architect, Reviewer) working autonomously or on-demand.

### What Gets Installed

Running `loom-daemon init` creates these files in your repository:

**Configuration (Commit these)**:
- `.loom/config.json` - Terminal settings and role assignments
- `.loom/roles/` - Custom agent role definitions (optional)
- `.loom/scripts/` - Helper scripts (worktree.sh, clean.sh)

**Documentation (Commit these)**:
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI context document for Claude Code (11KB template)
- `AGENTS.md` - Workflow coordination guide for agents

**Tooling (Commit these)**:
- `.claude/commands/` - Claude Code slash commands for each role
- `.codex/` - Codex configuration (if available)
- `.github/labels.yml` - Workflow label definitions

**Gitignored (Local only)**:
- `.loom/state.json` - Runtime terminal state
- `.loom/worktrees/` - Git worktrees for isolated work
- `.loom/*.log` - Application log files

### What Gets Modified

- **`.gitignore`** - Adds patterns for `.loom/state.json`, `.loom/worktrees/`, `~/.loom/console.log`, etc.

That's it! Loom is non-invasive and everything important can be committed to version control so your team shares the same agent configuration.

## What is Loom?

### Vision: GitHub as the Vibe Coding UI

When you run `loom`, GitHub becomes a *living, breathing* coding environment.

- The **README** defines your world—project purpose, tone, and architecture.
- You create **issues** as natural language prompts.
- Loom spawns **AI workers** that claim, implement, and review those issues.
- GitHub itself becomes the **shared whiteboard** for you and your AI collaborators.

Your only job: write issues, read pull requests, and merge what you like.
Everything else—branching, running tests, managing terminals, tracking progress—happens automatically.

### Core Concepts

**Current Implementation:**

Loom provides a **multi-terminal GUI** with configurable AI worker roles. Each terminal can be assigned a role that defines its behavior and automation level.

| Concept | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Terminal Roles** | Define specialized behaviors for each terminal (Worker, Reviewer, Architect, Curator, Issues) | ✅ Implemented |
| **File-based Configuration** | Role definitions stored as `.md` files in `.loom/roles/` with optional `.json` metadata | ✅ Implemented |
| **Label-based Workflow** | GitHub labels coordinate work between different agent types | ✅ Implemented |
| **Autonomous Mode** | Terminals can run at intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes) with configured prompts | ✅ Implemented |
| **Multi-terminal GUI** | Tauri-based app with xterm.js terminals, theme support, and persistent state | ✅ Implemented |

See [WORKFLOWS.md](WORKFLOWS.md) for detailed documentation of the agent coordination system.

## Label Workflow

Loom uses GitHub labels to coordinate work between different agent roles:

### Issue Labels

| Label | Color | Created By | Meaning |
|-------|-------|-----------|---------|
| `loom:architect` | 🔵 Blue | Architect | Suggestion awaiting approval |
| `loom:hermit` | 🔵 Blue | Critic | Removal/simplification awaiting approval |
| `loom:curated` | 🟠 Orange | Curator | Enhanced, awaiting human approval |
| `loom:issue` | 🟢 Green | Human | Approved for Worker to implement |
| `loom:in-progress` | 🟡 Amber | Worker | Being implemented |
| `loom:blocked` | 🔴 Red | Worker | Blocked, needs help |
| `loom:urgent` | 🔴 Dark Red | Triage | High priority (max 3) |

### PR Labels

| Label | Color | Created By | Meaning |
|-------|-------|-----------|---------|
| `loom:review-requested` | 🟢 Green | Worker/Fixer | PR ready for Reviewer |
| `loom:changes-requested` | 🟡 Amber | Reviewer | PR needs fixes from Fixer |
| `loom:pr` | 🔵 Blue | Reviewer | Approved, ready to merge |

For complete workflow documentation, see [WORKFLOWS.md](WORKFLOWS.md).

### Example Workflow

1. **Architect Bot** (autonomous, runs every 15 minutes) scans the codebase and creates an issue with `loom:architect` label:
   > "Add search functionality to terminal history"

2. **You** review the proposal. Remove `loom:architect` to approve it for curation (or close the issue to reject).

3. **Curator Bot** (autonomous, runs every 5 minutes) finds the approved issue, adds implementation details, test plans, and code references. Marks it as `loom:curated`.

4. **You** review the curated issue and explicitly add `loom:issue` label to approve it for implementation.

5. **Worker Bot** (manual or on-demand) finds `loom:issue` issues, claims it by adding `loom:in-progress`, implements the feature, creates a PR with "Closes #X", and adds `loom:review-requested`.

6. **Reviewer Bot** (autonomous, runs every 5 minutes) finds the PR, reviews the code, runs tests, and either:
   - Approves: adds `loom:pr` (ready for you to merge)
   - Requests changes: adds `loom:changes-requested` (for Fixer bot to address)

7. **You** merge the approved PR with `loom:pr` label. GitHub automatically closes the linked issue.

GitHub shows the whole lifecycle—Loom orchestrates it through labels and autonomous terminals with explicit human approval gates.

---

## Configuring Terminal Roles

After launching Loom, you can configure each terminal with a specific role:

1. Click the **settings icon** (⚙️) next to any terminal in the mini terminal row
2. Choose a role from the dropdown (Worker, Reviewer, Architect, Curator, Issues, or Default)
3. Configure autonomous mode:
   - **Autonomous**: Terminal runs at intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes)
   - **Interval Prompt**: The message sent at each interval (e.g., "Continue working on open tasks")
4. Click **Save** to apply the configuration

**Role Files**: All role definitions are stored in `.loom/roles/` as markdown files with optional JSON metadata. See [defaults/roles/README.md](defaults/roles/README.md) for details on creating custom roles.

---

## CLI Usage

### Workspace Initialization (Headless Mode)

Initialize a Loom workspace without launching the GUI app—perfect for CI/CD, headless servers, or manual orchestration:

```bash
# Initialize current directory
loom-daemon init

# Initialize specific repository
loom-daemon init /path/to/your/repo

# Preview changes without applying them
loom-daemon init --dry-run

# Overwrite existing .loom directory
loom-daemon init --force

# Custom defaults directory
loom-daemon init --defaults ./custom-defaults
```

**What Gets Installed**:
- `.loom/` - Configuration directory with terminal roles and settings
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI context documentation for Claude Code
- `AGENTS.md` - Agent workflow and coordination guide
- `.claude/` - Claude Code slash commands and configuration
- `.codex/` - Codex configuration (if available)
- `.github/` - GitHub workflow templates and label definitions
- `.gitignore` - Updated with Loom ephemeral patterns

**Use Cases**:
- **Manual Orchestration**: Set up Loom in a repo and run agents manually (`claude --role builder`)
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Initialize Loom as part of your build/deploy process
- **Headless Servers**: Install Loom configuration without GUI dependencies
- **Bulk Setup**: Script initialization across multiple repositories

**Comprehensive Documentation**:
- **[Getting Started Guide](docs/guides/getting-started.md)** - Complete installation walkthrough
- **[CLI Reference](docs/guides/cli-reference.md)** - Full command documentation with all flags and exit codes
- **[CI/CD Setup](docs/guides/ci-cd-setup.md)** - Integration examples for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, and more
- **[Troubleshooting](docs/guides/troubleshooting.md#initialization-issues)** - Debug initialization failures

### Launching the GUI

Loom supports command-line arguments for headless automation and remote development workflows:

```bash
# Launch with a specific workspace
./Loom.app/Contents/MacOS/Loom --workspace /path/to/your/repo

# Short form
./Loom.app/Contents/MacOS/Loom -w /path/to/your/repo
```

**Use Cases**:
- Automated deployment: Launch Loom with a pre-configured workspace on server startup
- Remote development: Start Loom via SSH with a specific repository path

The app will validate the workspace path and automatically load the configuration from `.loom/config.json` if it exists.

### MCP Servers for Testing and Automation

Loom provides three Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that enable AI agents like Claude Code to interact with the application programmatically:

- **[mcp-loom-ui](docs/mcp/loom-ui.md)** - Interact with UI, console logs, and workspace state
- **[mcp-loom-logs](docs/mcp/loom-logs.md)** - Access daemon, Tauri, and terminal logs
- **[mcp-loom-terminals](docs/mcp/loom-terminals.md)** - Control terminals via daemon IPC

**Use Cases**:
- Testing factory reset and agent launches
- Monitoring agent activity in real-time
- Debugging terminal and IPC issues
- Automating workspace operations

**Quick Start**:
```bash
# Build MCP servers
pnpm build

# Configure in .mcp.json (already included)
# Use from Claude Code:
mcp__loom-ui__read_console_log({ lines: 100 })
mcp__loom-terminals__list_terminals()
```

**Full documentation**: [docs/mcp/README.md](docs/mcp/README.md)

---

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all workspace tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run daemon integration tests
pnpm run daemon:test

# Run with verbose output (see logs)
pnpm run daemon:test:verbose

# Run specific test
cargo test --test integration_basic test_ping_pong -- --nocapture
```

**Requirements**: Tests require `tmux` installed (`brew install tmux` on macOS)

---

---

## Remote Sandboxes (Long-Term)

The Loom daemon will eventually manage **remote sandboxes**—lightweight ephemeral environments (local VMs, SSH hosts, or cloud containers) for running workers in isolation.

| Future Target                 | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local Sandboxes**           | Use Docker or Podman for isolated builds/tests.                               |
| **Remote Hosts**              | Deploy workers on LAN machines or cloud VMs via SSH.                          |
| **Ephemeral Cloud Sandboxes** | API-driven one-shot environments spun up per task (e.g. Fly.io, AWS Fargate). |
| **Cluster Coordination**      | Workers register via Unix socket or HTTP heartbeat; daemon balances load.     |

Goal: **scale Loom beyond your laptop**—one repo, many AI workers, distributed across machines.

---

## Philosophy

> *Like a traditional loom weaves threads into fabric, Loom weaves AI agents into cohesive software systems.*

Loom aims to make **autonomous, self-improving development** natural—
you define goals, and the system builds, reviews, and learns from itself.

### The Archetypal System

Each terminal can embody one of six archetypal forces (see [Agent Archetypes](docs/philosophy/agent-archetypes.md)):

- 🔮 **Worker** (The Magician) - Transforms ideas into reality
- 📚 **Curator** (The High Priestess) - Refines chaos into clarity
- 🏛️ **Architect** (The Emperor) - Envisions structure and design
- ⚖️ **Reviewer** (Justice) - Maintains quality through discernment
- 🔍 **Critic** (The Hermit) - Questions to find truth
- 🔧 **Fixer** (The Hanged Man) - Heals what is broken

*Like the Tarot's Major Arcana or Jung's archetypes, each role represents a universal pattern in software development. When working in harmony, they transform chaos into creation.*

### Architecture Bot (Human-in-the-Loop Design)

In Loom's future ecosystem, an **Architecture Bot** will run periodically to scan the codebase, documentation, and open issues to surface structural opportunities—not tasks.

It creates new GitHub issues labelled **`loom:architect`**, which might include:

- "Refactor terminal session handling into a reusable module"
- "Extract common code between Claude and GPT workers"
- "Add healthcheck endpoints to remote sandboxes"
- "Document the worker orchestration state machine"

These issues are **never acted on automatically**.

They are **owned by the human**—the architect who defines the system's intent and approves direction.
The **`loom:architect`** label acts as a *safety interlock*:

- As long as `loom:architect` is present, the Curator Bot will ignore the issue.
- Once the human removes the label (confirming it's worth pursuing), the Curator Bot can refine and re-label it as `loom:curated`.
- The human must then explicitly add `loom:issue` to approve it for implementation, enabling the normal Worker lifecycle.

This keeps the feedback loop safe and directional with two explicit human approval gates.
